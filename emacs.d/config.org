#+TITLE: Emacs Configuration
#+AUTHOR: Matt Phillips

Boilerplate for a ~/.emacs.d/config.org emacs configuration using
"Sane Defaults".

Steps to making this file yours:

1) Change all instances of "Your Name Here" to your name.
2) Change all instances of "your@email.here" to your email address.
3) Create ~/.emacs.d/custom.el even if it's empty.
   Emacs will now write your (interactive) customizations to that
   file.
4) Change the Sane Defaults if you need to.
   For example if you read and write Chinese and so prefer to default
   to utf-16.
5) Teach yourself what goes into your backup directories
   ~/.emacs.d/backups
   ~/.emacs.d/auto-save-list
   So you'll know where to look for older versions of files that
   you've edited.
6) Delete these instructions and replace them with a personalized
   introduction.

* Personal Information

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq user-full-name "Matt Phillips"
      user-mail-address "mattman@mattcave.com")
#+end_src

* Customize settings

Set up the customize file to its own separate file, instead of saving
customize settings in [[file:init.el][init.el]].

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
(load custom-file)
#+end_src

* Sane defaults

Let's start with some sane defaults, shall we?

The following function for ~occur-dwim~ is taken from [[https://github.com/abo-abo][Oleh Krehel]] from
[[http://oremacs.com/2015/01/26/occur-dwim/][his blog post at (or emacs]]. It takes the current region or the symbol
at point as the default value for occur.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun occur-dwim ()
  "Call `occur' with a sane default."
  (interactive)
  (push (if (region-active-p)
            (buffer-substring-no-properties
