#   ${var#pattern}          delete shortest part of the match at beginning of var
#   ${var##pattern}         delete longest part of the match at beginning of var
#   ${var%pattern}          delete shortest part of the match at end of var
#   ${var%%pattern}         delete longest part of match at end of var
#   ${var/pattern/string}   longest match to pattern is replaced by string (first)
#   ${var//pattern/string}  longest match to pattern is globally replaced by string
#   ${var,,}                convert $var to lowercase
#   ${var^^}                convert $var to uppercase

# alternative to basename
path_basename="${path##*}"

# alternative to dirname
path_dirname="${path%/*}"

# to rename files removing ".bak" extension
for fn in *.bak; do
  mv "$fn" "${fn%.bak}"
done
